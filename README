Inject shared libraries wich works for x86/x64 with having in mind the simplest way to do it.
I saw a lot of different methods for injecting shared libraries into a remote process,
but none of them worked for me or just crashed, so I made my own.
Usage:
1) Type make when you cloned the repo (you'll need the build-essentials/gcc in order to compile it)
2) Then run ./inject32.dbg or ./inject64.dbg depending on the process arch you want to inject the shared library in:

./inject32.dbg <process id> <path of the shared library>
./inject64.dbg <process id> <path of the shared library>
